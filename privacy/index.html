        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Thanks for visiting <strong>isaacd2.com</strong> — home of <strong>Fickle Friday</strong> and a few other fun projects down the road. I want to be transparent about what information is collected and how it’s used.</p>
        
        <h2>1. What I Collect (and Why)</h2>
        <p>When you interact with this site (like subscribing to Fickle Friday or submitting forms), I may collect:</p>
        <p><strong>Your email address</strong> – so I can send you the weekly Fickle Friday newsletter or updates you’ve signed up for.</p>
        <p><strong>Your name (if provided)</strong> – to personalize things a bit.</p>
        <p><strong>Timestamps and IP address</strong> – for analytics and spam prevention, stored securely and not used to track you.</p>

        <p>All of this is handled through serverless tech (<strong>AWS Lambda</strong>) and securely stored in <strong>Amazon DynamoDB</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>2. What I Don’t Do</h2>
        <p>I don’t sell or share your data.</p>
        <p>I don’t use invasive trackers or targeted advertising outside of industry standards.</p>
        <p>I don’t collect sensitive info like payment details or personal IDs.</p>
        
        <h2>3. How Your Data Is Protected</h2>
        <p>I use <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong>, which provides top-notch security practices. Only I (Isaac) have access to the systems handling your data, and I take that responsibility seriously.</p>
    
        <h2>4. Opting Out</h2>
        <p>You can unsubscribe from emails at any time via the link in each email. If you ever want your info deleted completely, just send me a note at <a href="mailto:hi@isaacd2.com">hi@isaacd2.com</a> — I’ll take care of it.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If I ever change how your data is handled, I’ll update this page.</p>
        
        <p>If you have any questions, just reach out. I’m a real person behind this site, and I’m happy to help.</p>
        
        <p>Keep experimenting,<br><strong>Isaac D2</strong></p>
